# Digital-Music-Store-Analysis-SQL-Project
This project involves performing a deep-dive data analysis on a simulated Digital Music Store database using SQL. The core objective is to extract meaningful business insights by writing and executing complex SQL queries against a provided relational schema.
# üé∂ SQL Data Analysis: Digital Music Store Performance

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **SQL data analysis project** focused on extracting actionable business intelligence from a **Digital Music Store database**. 

The goal is to provide insights into customer demographics, sales performance, employee efficiency, and inventory effectiveness to help the music store make data-driven decisions.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
1.  **Analyze Sales Performance:** Determine key metrics like total revenue, best-selling artists, and top-spending customers.
2.  **Evaluate Employee Performance:** Identify the employee(s) who generated the highest total sales revenue.
3.  **Understand Customer Geography:** Pinpoint the countries and cities with the highest sales volume.
4.  **Master Advanced SQL:** Demonstrate proficiency in writing complex, efficient SQL queries utilizing JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregate functions, and subqueries to solve real-world business problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

| Category | Tool / Language | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | Relational Database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL) | The environment where the music store data resides. |
| **Language** | **SQL (Structured Query Language)** | Used for all data querying and analysis. |
| **Files** | SQL Script (`sql_query.sql`) | Contains all the executed queries for the business questions. |
| **Schema** | `MusicDatabaseSchema.png` | Visual representation of the database structure. |

## üìÅ Repository Contents

* `sql_query.sql`: The main file containing all the SQL queries written to answer the business questions. Each query is typically commented to describe the problem it solves.
* `Analysis-Questions.pdf`: The list of specific analytical questions that the SQL queries are designed to answer (e.g., "Who is the senior-most employee?", "Which city has the best customers?").
* `MusicDatabaseSchema.png`: An image showing the database structure, including all tables (Customer, Invoice, Track, Artist, etc.) and their relationships.

## üí° Key Analytical Questions Answered (Examples)

The SQL script addresses questions such as:
* Which country has the most invoices?
* What are the top 3 best-selling artists?
* Which is the best customer (the one who spent the most money)?
* Which cities have the highest average invoice totals?
* What is the most popular music genre for each country?

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1.  **Setup the Database:** Load the music store schema (if not already done) into your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
2.  **Open the Script:** Open the `sql_query.sql` file in your SQL client.
3.  **Execute Queries:** Run the queries sequentially to see the results and business insights generated.
